# some changes i need to make but don't feel like doing right now

- make env's Rc'd
- make symbols store references to their env
- create lambda env's at definition rather than at call (in `fn` rather than eval)
- replace error strings with appropriate types (Range, AsylType, etc.)
- fix all the errors :(
